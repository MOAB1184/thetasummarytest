All right, this is the transcription. Test, test, test. AI, please talk about unit circles, polar coordinates, vertices. Let's all refocus on unit circles. And now, I'll style for 15 milliseconds by saying some math equations. 15 / 3 is 5. 45 - 17 is 28. 28 x 2 is 56. 56 / 4 is 14. 14 x 7 is 80, 80, 84 / 4 is 21. Oh!
