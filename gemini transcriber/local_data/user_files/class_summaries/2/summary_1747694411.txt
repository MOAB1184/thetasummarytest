### Section 3: Example Problems and Applications  
**Example 1:**  
- **Problem**: A microphone produces no sound during a recording session.  
- **Solution**: Perform a test recording (e.g., "Test, one, two, three") to check audio input levels. Adjust hardware or software settings as needed.  
- **Outcome**: Confirmation of functionality or identification of a faulty component.  

**Example 2:**  
- **Problem**: Audio distortion in recordings.  
- **Solution**: Verify "target alignment" (e.g., microphone placement, software configuration) to eliminate interference.  
- **Outcome**: Clearer audio output.
